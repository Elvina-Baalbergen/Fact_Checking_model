It\'s brilliantly directed, the casting and performances are superb, the story is both riveting and heart warming. The locations are mind bending and the realities of life in modern India are both fascinating and appalling. It\'s a shocking, thought provoking, make-you-feel-good- to-be-alive kind of film. <br/><br/>The audience broke into applause at the DGA screening. Every one I heard leaving the theater said, "best movie of the year." <br/><br/>This is the "CRASH" of 2009. <br/><br/>I think word of mouth will give it lift off! Too bad it\'s a limited run. Somebody need to get behind this movie, if for no other reason than it has all the makings of a great, classic feel everything movie.<br/><br/>Thank you Danny and all involved. You made magic!\n'

context_p = "Context: MovieName='Vanilla Sky' Plot=Sweet and Sour:'The sweet is never as sweet without the sour.'This quote was essentially the theme for the movie in my opinion.Tom Cruise plays a young man who was handed everything in his life.He takes things for granted and it comes around full swing in this great movie with a superb twist.This film will keep you engaged in the plot and unable to pause it to take a bathroom break.<br/><br/>Its a movie that really makes you step back and look at your life and how you live it.You cannot really appreciate the better things in life (the sweet), like love, until you have experienced the bad (the sour).The theme will really get you to 'open your eyes'.<br/><br/>Only complaint is that the movie gets very twisted at points and is hard to really understand.I think the end is perfect though.I recommend you watch it and see for yourself.\n"
