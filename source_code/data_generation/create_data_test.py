It\'s brilliantly directed, the casting and performances are superb, the story is both riveting and heart warming. The locations are mind bending and the realities of life in modern India are both fascinating and appalling. It\'s a shocking, thought provoking, make-you-feel-good- to-be-alive kind of film. <br/><br/>The audience broke into applause at the DGA screening. Every one I heard leaving the theater said, "best movie of the year." <br/><br/>This is the "CRASH" of 2009. <br/><br/>I think word of mouth will give it lift off! Too bad it\'s a limited run. Somebody need to get behind this movie, if for no other reason than it has all the makings of a great, classic feel everything movie.<br/><br/>Thank you Danny and all involved. You made magic!\n'
